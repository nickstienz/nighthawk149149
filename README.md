# About
I am interested in Computer Science and love to program whenever I have the time. I started programming in 2017 and continue to spend as much time possible working on my projects.

My favorite languages are Lua and Rust where I can make many different applications. I spend most of my time working with Rust creating applications and crates to help make anyones life easier. I hope to expand my knowledge in order to maintain my code.
